# A \ctxt can be indicated to explain, for example, that a new \chap
# has started. Technically, a \ctxt can be a text using optional auto
# \refs. Here are some examples of use.
#
#     1) Explicit path: ''./Chap-A/lesson/lesson.tex''. The path is
#     relative to the folder associated to the \grp in the
#     path::''cfg.yaml'' file.
#
#     1) Implicit path: ''./Chap-A''. This implies to follow the \dir
#     \orga imposed by \thisproj.
#
#     1) Text without any \ref: ''Chapter A: Start to learn LaTeX''.
#
#     1) Text using \refs: ''Informatic - pw4p25''. Here \this proj
#     will produce "Informatic - Practical work 4 page 25".

# A test, or assignment, is indicated via one \desc similar to the
# ones allow fo the \ctxts (see above). You can also give the duration.
# Here are some examples of use.
#
#     1) Explicit path: ''(1h30min) ./common-test/2024/math.tex'' is
#     for a test with a duration of time(txt)::"1h30min". Like for
#     lessons, the path is relative to the folder associated to the \grp
#     in the path::''cfg.yaml'' file.
#
#     1) Implicit path: ''(1h30min) ./common-test/2024''. This implies
#     to follow the \dir \orga imposed by \thisproj.
#
#     1) Text without any \ref: ''(1h30min) Common test''. This is for
#     a test named "Common test".
#
#     1) Text using \refs: ''(10min) Short test - ex6p66 and ex9p99''.
#     Here \this proj will produce "Short test - Exercice 6 page 66 and
#     exercice 9 page 99 [Duration: 10 min]".
#
#     1) No duration: just omit ''(1h30min)'' as in ''./common-test/2024''
#     and ''Common test'' for example.

# The main content of a daily class log is devoted to the following
# categories, each fed by a list of optionally timed \seqs, and possibly
# with \refs as for tests and \ctxts.
#
#    1) ''cor'': this is the \cors made during the course.
#
#    1) ''done'': this is the work done during the course.
#
#    1) ''out'': sometimes the course takes place outside (think of
#    a visit to a museum, for example).
###
  - KIND* | in("cor", "done", "out"): >

###
# To indicate the work to be done at home, a ''key-val'' \dict must be
# used. The \vals use a similar lists to the ones allowed for the ''cor'',
# 'done'', ... blocks. The keys must be of the following kinds.
#
#    1) ''next'': this is for the next \seq associated to the actual \grp.
#
#    1) ''09'' with an optional leading zero: this for the next day with
#    number ''09'' (\thisproj is smart enough to guess the good month and
#    year of the expected day).
#
#    1) ''04-09'' with optional leading zeroes: this for the next day with
#    number ''09'' for the month ''04'' (\thisproj is smart enough to
#    guess the good year of the expected day).
#
#    1) ''2024-04-09'' with optional leading zeroes: only anxious users
#    who need to write everything down.
