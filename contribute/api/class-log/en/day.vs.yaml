# A \ctxt can be indicated to explain, for example, that a new \chap
# has started. Technically, a \ctxt can be a text using optional auto
# \refs. Here are some examples of use.
#
#     1) Explicit \ref: ''./Chap-A/lesson/lesson.tex''. The path is
#     relative to the folder associated to the \grp in the
#     path::''cfg.yaml'' file.
#
#     1) Implicit \ref: ''./Chap-A''. This implies to follow the \dir
#     \orga imposed by \thisproj.
#
#     1) One text: ''Chapter A: Start to learn LaTeX''.
#
#     1) Text using \refs: ''Informatic - pw4p25''. Here \this proj
#     will produce "Informatic - Practical work 4 page 25".

# A test, or assignment, is indicated via one \desc similar to the
# ones allow fo the \ctxts (see above). You can also give the duration.
# Here are some examples of use.
#
#     1) Explicit \ref: ''(1h30min) ./common-test/2024/math.tex''. Like
#     for lessons, the path is relative to the folder associated to the
#     \grp in the path::''cfg.yaml'' file.
#
#     1) Implicit \ref: ''(1h30min) ./common-test/2024''. This implies
#     to follow the \dir \orga imposed by \thisproj.
#
#     1) One text: ''(1h30min) Common test''. This is for a test named
#     "Common test" with a duration of time(txt)::"1h30min".
#
#     1) Text using \refs: ''(10min) Short test - ex6p66 and also ex9p99''.
#     Here \this proj will produce "Short test - Exercice 6 page 66 and
#     also Exercice 9 page 99".
#
#     1) No duration: just omit ''1h30min'' as in ''./common-test/2024''
#     and ''Common test'' for example.
