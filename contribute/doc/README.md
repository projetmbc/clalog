Where are the translations?
---------------------------

The translations made are in the `contribute/doc` folder which has the following minimal structure.

<!-- FOLDER STRUCT. AUTO - START -->

    + doc
        * LICENSE.txt
        * README.md
        + changes
            * LICENSE.txt

<!-- FOLDER STRUCT. AUTO - END -->


Start a new translation
-----------------------

As the author of `src2prod` is a French amateur coder, the documentation is only actively maintained in French. Here is how to translate it.

  1. Start by copying and pasting the main `doc` folder where you want to do your translation.

  1. Translate the files without touching the structure used (the writing language used is `tns`, it is very intuitive).

  1. Once the work is well advanced, or even finished, send it to the author of `src2prod`.

----------------------

If you wish to update a translation proposal, you should quickly indicate in English the changes made and date them (no need to go into too much detail).
